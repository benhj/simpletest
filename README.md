A extremely simple C++ test framework
-------------------------------------

- Provides a very simple assertion macro for testing simple program logic
- For when far better frameworks (e.g. CPPUNIT, google..) are just too heavy...

To use, simply include SimpleTest.hpp. An example is shown in test.cpp.
Requires some of the boost headers (format and progress).

Main caveat
-----------
No exception handling
